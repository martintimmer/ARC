# ARC Aspect Ratio Calculator

ARC Aspect Ratio Calculator is a focused, offline-ready workspace for cinematographers, editors, and motion designers who need fast, trustworthy framing math. The interface blends a dark, filmic UI with tactile controls so you can dial in original and target dimensions, apply squeeze ratios, and immediately see the resulting frame. A minimalist preview frame scales to the calculated ratio, while external dimension labels keep the canvas clean and production friendly. The app also interprets the ratio against common movie standards, returning the closest match, percent variance, delivery context, and typical sensor modes, plus tags like Streaming-Safe, IMAX-Centric, or Anamorphic-Native for quick decision making.

Everything runs in a single HTML page with one CSS file and one JS bundle for clean, portable distribution. There are no external dependencies or network calls, which makes ARC ideal for on-set use, offline dailies review, or a quiet toolbox on a laptop. The calculator preserves the original behavior of classic aspect ratio tools but modernizes the flow: four inputs, instant solve, round-toggle, and curated presets from SD through 8K. A texture toggle and dark-mode defaults keep the environment comfortable for late-night grading or scouting sessions. Its squeeze handling mirrors anamorphic workflows, letting you preview de-squeezed frames without guessing. Standards metadata exposes sensor recommendations and delivery notes, so teams can align on capture and finishing targets. All settings persist locally, keeping sessions consistent between shoots and revisions and production meetings across departments easily.

ARC is designed to grow. Future enhancements can include custom camera presets, safe-area overlays, delivery spec templates, anamorphic lens profiles, or exportable framing slates. Whether you are planning for theatrical projection, streaming deliverables, or experimental formats, ARC helps you make ratio decisions confidently and consistently. It is intentionally fast, visually restrained, and structured to feel like a daily companion rather than a one-off calculator.
